Broadsheet.ie Android App
===========

An Android app for displaying a WordPress blog, in this case Broadsheet.ie. This app uses a JSON feed produced by the [JSON API plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/) (you'll need to use my [fork](https://github.com/kmonaghan/wp-json-api) though) and displays it in a reasonable manner.
